# Machine Learning

This repository contains my implementations of various machine learning algorithms, each of which are organized by it's corresponding folders. These have been implemented in python using libraries such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib and scikit-learn. Some of these algorithms, like PCA, gradient descent, etc have been scripted from scratch using their concepts. However, binary support vector machine was implemented in part from scikit-learn. Feel free to take a look.
